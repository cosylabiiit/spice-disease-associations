# Data-driven analysis of biomedical literature suggests broad-spectrum benevolence of culinary herbs and spices.

## Abstract
Spices and herbs are key dietary ingredients used across cultures worldwide. Beyond their use as
flavoring and coloring agents, the popularity of these aromatic plant products in culinary
preparations has been attributed to their antimicrobial properties. Last few decades have witnessed
an exponential growth of biomedical literature discussing the impact of spices and herbs on health,
presenting an opportunity to mine for patterns from empirical evidence. Systematic investigation
of literature to enumerate the health consequences of culinary herbs and spices can provide
valuable insights into their therapeutic utility. We implemented a text mining protocol to assess
the health impact of spices by assimilating, both, their positive and negative effects. We conclude
that spices show broad-spectrum benevolence across a range of disease categories in contrast to
negative effects that are comparatively narrow-spectrum. We also implement a strategy for
disease-specific culinary recommendations of spices based on their therapeutic tradeoff against
adverse effects. Further by integrating spice-phytochemical-disease associations, we identify
bioactive spice phytochemicals potentially involved in their therapeutic effects. Thus, our study
provides a systems perspective on health effects of culinary spices and herbs with applications for
dietary recommendations as well as identification of phytochemicals potentially involved in
underlying molecular mechanisms.
